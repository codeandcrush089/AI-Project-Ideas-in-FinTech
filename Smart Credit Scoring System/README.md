# **Project: Smart Credit Scoring System (Beyond Traditional Credit Bureau)**

### **Objective**

Develop an AI-powered credit scoring engine that evaluates a user’s creditworthiness using **alternative data sources** (e-commerce spending, utility bills, social media behavior, banking patterns) rather than relying solely on traditional credit bureaus.

---

## **1. Project Roadmap (Step-by-Step)**

### **Phase 1: Requirement Analysis**

* Define target audience: underbanked, gig workers, students, or general banking customers.
* Set scoring range (e.g., 0–1000 or A–E).
* Identify compliance: GDPR, CCPA, Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA).

---

### **Phase 2: Data Collection & Integration**

* Data Sources:

  * Banking transactions (income, repayments, savings).
  * Utility bill payments (electricity, phone, internet).
  * E-commerce purchase history.
  * Mobile wallet usage.
  * Social & digital footprint (optional, for advanced version).

* Integration:

  * **APIs**: Plaid, Yodlee, Salt Edge, or banking open APIs.
  * Web scraping (for public financial data patterns).

---

### **Phase 3: Data Preprocessing**

* Clean and normalize financial records.

* Handle missing values and outliers.

* Transform categorical data (one-hot/target encoding).

* Derive features:

  * Debt-to-income ratio
  * Payment history consistency
  * Spending-to-income trends
  * Social credit signals (if used)

* Address class imbalance: creditworthy vs. high-risk applicants.

---

### **Phase 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Visualize repayment behaviors.
* Correlation analysis between alternative data and repayment likelihood.
* Analyze credit risk patterns per demographic and spending clusters.

---

### **Phase 5: Model Development**

**Approach:**

* Baseline: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees.
* Advanced: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost.
* Deep Learning: Neural Networks with embeddings for categorical features.

**Target:**

* Predict probability of default (PD).
* Map prediction to credit score bands.

---

### **Phase 6: Scoring Engine Development**

* Real-time API-based scoring (FastAPI/Flask).
* Adjustable thresholds based on risk tolerance.
* Weighting system for alternative vs. traditional data.

---

### **Phase 7: Dashboard & Visualization**

* Dashboard for lenders/fintech firms.
* KPIs:

  * Average credit score by segment
  * Default probability trends
  * Geographic risk heatmap
* Tools: Power BI, Tableau, Streamlit.

---

### **Phase 8: Deployment & Maintenance**

* Cloud-based deployment: AWS (SageMaker), Azure ML, or GCP AI.
* Continuous learning:

  * Update model with new repayment history.
  * Recalculate weights dynamically.
