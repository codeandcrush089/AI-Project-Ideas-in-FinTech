# 1) Project Objective

Build an algorithmic trading system that **learns trading policies with reinforcement learning (DRL)**, supports backtesting and paper/live trading, and includes monitoring, risk controls, and explainability.

# 2) Step-by-Step Roadmap

### Phase 0: Scope & Constraints

* Choose asset class: equities, ETFs, futures, forex, crypto. (Start with one — e.g., US equities or crypto.)
* Decide frequency: intraday (1m/5m), daily, or weekly.
* Define constraints: max drawdown, position sizing rules, transaction costs, slippage model.

### Phase 1: Data Collection & Storage

* Historical OHLCV, order book (if available), fundamentals, corporate actions, news/sentiment.
* Store in time-series DB (Parquet files / PostgreSQL / ClickHouse).
* Suggested data providers/APIs: Alpaca, Polygon, Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, Yahoo (yfinance). ([Medium][1], [Medium][2])

### Phase 2: Data Engineering & Feature Store

* Resample to chosen frequency; compute technical indicators (EMA, RSI, MACD), rolling statistics, volatility, volume profile.
* Create environment inputs: price returns, normalized features, order-book features (if available), macro features and sentiment.
* Build a feature store so training and live inference use identical transforms.

### Phase 3: Environment & Reward Design

* Implement an OpenAI Gym-style trading environment (or use FinRL frameworks) that supports:

  * Action space: discrete (buy/hold/sell) or continuous (fractional position).
  * Observation: last N timesteps of feature vectors.
  * Reward: portfolio P\&L, risk-adjusted return (Sharpe), or custom reward with penalty for drawdown/turnover.
* Include realistic transaction cost and slippage simulation. (FinRL gives good templates.) ([GitHub][3])

### Phase 4: Algorithm Selection & Training

* Start with standard DRL algorithms: **PPO**, **A2C**, **DDPG/TD3** (for continuous), **SAC**, or use Stable-Baselines3 / RLlib.
* Try model-free methods first; experiment with model-based later. Use ensembles for stability. FinRL integrates SB3 / RLlib. ([Medium][4], [pyRDDLGym][5])

### Phase 5: Backtesting & Walk-Forward Validation

* Backtest with realistic transaction costs, latency, and slippage.
* Use **walk-forward** or time-series cross-validation to check robustness.
* Beware overfitting to backtest data.

### Phase 6: Paper Trading / Simulated Live

* Connect model output to a paper trading sandbox (Alpaca or broker sandbox) to measure real-time performance and latency. ([Medium][1])

### Phase 7: Production Deployment & Risk Controls

* Deploy scoring service (FastAPI) + scheduler.
* Add risk engine: max exposure, stop-loss, circuit breakers, position limits, and throttling.
* Logging, metrics (returns, drawdown, Sharpe), alerting.

### Phase 8: Monitoring, Retraining & Governance

* Model drift detection, retrain cadence, and guardrails (don’t auto-deploy a model that blows up paper trading).
* Add explainability (feature importance, SHAP on state-action values) and audit logs.

# 4) Real Datasets & APIs (Concrete list)

### Public / Community Datasets

* **Kaggle: Stock Market Datasets** (daily price archives, multi-year). ([Kaggle][6])
* **QuantConnect Datasets** — broad historical data, alternatives, and 1-minute bars for backtesting (free & paid). ([QuantConnect][7])
* **Polygon / IEX / Alpha Vantage** free tiers for historical/intraday data. ([Medium][1], [Nordic APIs][8])

### Recommended APIs for prototyping → production

* **yfinance** (Python wrapper) — quick prototyping (not for production). ([Medium][1])
* **Alpha Vantage** — free API quotas, historical & intraday. ([Nordic APIs][8])
* **Polygon.io** — low-latency intraday/tick data for production (paid). ([Medium][2])
* **Alpaca** — paper & live brokerage API, easy for trading and market data. ([Medium][1])
* **IEX Cloud / Finnhub / Twelve Data** — alternatives for different pricing/coverage. ([DEV Community][9])

### Research & Frameworks (code + papers)

* **FinRL** — end-to-end DRL framework for finance (notably used in academic work; includes notebooks and DRL agents). Great starting point. ([GitHub][3], [openfin.engineering.columbia.edu][10])
* **Stable-Baselines3 / RLlib** — mature RL libraries used with FinRL. ([pyRDDLGym][5])

# 5) Ready-to-Use Advanced Version — Features & Architecture

### Architecture (Production-grade)

* **Data Layer**: Delta / Parquet storage, daily/1-min ingestion pipelines, metadata catalog.
* **Feature Layer**: Real-time feature computation service (Kafka + Spark/Beam).
* **Model Layer**: DRL training cluster (GPU when using neural policies), model registry (MLflow).
* **Execution Layer**: Low-latency order gateway to broker (Alpaca/IB/own FIX gateway).
* **Observability**: Prometheus + Grafana for metrics; ELK for logs.

### Advanced Capabilities (ready-to-use)

1. **Ensemble DRL**: Combine policies from PPO, SAC, and a supervised alpha model; meta-controller chooses or weights actions.
2. **Hierarchical RL**: High-level agent chooses asset allocation; low-level agent executes trades minimizing market impact.
3. **GNN + RL for Cross-Asset**: Use graph neural networks to model relationships (e.g., sector/ETF links) and feed to agent.
4. **Safe RL & Constraint Handling**: Use constrained RL (penalty-based reward shaping or projection methods) to enforce risk limits at training time.
5. **Imitation Learning Warm-Start**: Pretrain policy by imitating a simple rule-based strategy before RL fine-tuning.
6. **Multi-objective Rewards**: Optimize for return and drawdown simultaneously (Pareto front / scalarization).
7. **Live A/B with Canarying**: Canary deployments to 1% of capital with risk caps; automatic rollback if metrics degrade.

# 8) Evaluation Metrics & Validation (must-have)

* Return metrics: cumulative return, annualized return.
* Risk metrics: max drawdown, volatility, Sortino/Sharpe ratio.
* Trading metrics: win rate, average trade P\&L, turnover, slippage.
* Robustness: stress tests across market regimes (volatile vs calm).
* Statistical significance: bootstrap test vs baseline.

---

# 9) Important Practical Notes & Risks

* **Lookahead / Data Leakage**: Be extremely careful — many RL/ML trading failures are due to subtle leakage. Always use proper chronological splits and realistic live simulation.
* **Overfitting**: DRL models can overfit to historical microstructure; use walk-forward and multiple market regimes.
* **Execution & Market Impact**: Good backtests that ignore market impact are useless in production. Model realistic costs.
* **Regulatory & Ethical**: Automated trading has regulatory constraints depending on jurisdiction; follow broker rules and market regulations.
* **Multi-agent and Collusion risk**: Recent research shows independent algorithmic traders can exhibit emergent collusive behaviours in simulations — design guardrails and monitor for unintended coordination. ([Tom's Hardware][11])

2. Week 2: Implement Gym trading environment + cost model.
3. Week 3–4: Train a baseline RL agent (PPO) with FinRL/SB3 on a single stock/ETF; simple reward = daily portfolio return.
4. Week 5: Backtest with walk-forward validation and add risk controls (max position, stop loss).
