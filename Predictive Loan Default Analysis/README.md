# 1. Project Objective

Predict probability of default (PD) for loans (retail consumer, SME, or microloans) so lenders can price risk, set limits, make automated decisions, and prioritize collections — while ensuring fairness, explainability and regulatory compliance.

---

# 2. End-to-end Roadmap (step-by-step)

### Phase 0 — Define Scope & KPIs

* Choose loan type (consumer, mortgage, SME, payday, P2P).
* Define prediction horizon (30/60/90/360 days, loan-term).
* Business KPIs: AUC, Precision\@k, KS-statistic, Population Stability Index (PSI), expected loss, calibration, and monetized metrics (cost of default avoided).

### Phase 1 — Data Collection & Integration

* Internal: loan origination, repayment history, payment schedules, delinquencies, collections, underwriting data, guarantor info.
* External: bank transaction history, bureau scores, employment & income verification, utility payments, telecom payment history, psychometric / alternative data (if applicable).
* Logs: application timestamps, channel, device fingerprint.
* Storage: secure data lake (Parquet), relational DB for metadata.

### Phase 2 — Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Canonicalize identifiers (customer, loan id), join datasets, handle duplicate entries.
* Missing value strategy: domain-aware imputation (e.g., “no previous loan” vs missing).
* Outlier handling and winsorization for skewed financial fields.
* Align time-series for each borrower (lookback windows).

### Phase 3 — Feature Engineering

* Behavior features: historical repayment rate, days past due (DPD) history, rolling default counts.
* Financial ratios: debt-to-income (DTI), payment-to-income, utilization, savings ratio.
* Time features: seasonality, days since last loan, age of account.
* Transaction-derived features: cash inflows/outflows, volatility, recurring salary deposits.
* Derived features: velocity (applications in last X days), device-change rate, geo mismatch.
* Categorical encoding: target encoding, frequency encoding, embeddings for high-cardinality fields.

### Phase 4 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Distribution of PD across segments, correlation heatmaps, PSI over time, churn/default cohorts, missingness patterns.
* Visualize feature importance and partial dependence for high-impact features.

### Phase 5 — Model Development

* Baseline: Logistic Regression (with calibration), decision trees.
* Tree boosting: XGBoost / LightGBM / CatBoost (most common for tabular credit risk).
* Advanced: neural nets with categorical embeddings, TabNet, or AutoGluon ensembles.
* Time-to-event / survival analysis: Cox models or survival forests to predict time-until-default.
* Calibration & uncertainty: isotonic or Platt scaling, conformal prediction for prediction intervals.

### Phase 6 — Explainability & Fairness

* Global & local explainability: SHAP values, partial dependence, rule-extraction for high-risk segments.
* Fairness audits: disparate impact ratio, equalized odds checks, group-wise performance metrics.
* Adverse action-ready outputs (reason codes) for denied applicants.

### Phase 7 — Validation & Stress Testing

* Backtesting with historical cohorts, walk-forward validation, temporal cross-validation.
* Population stability checks, scenario stress tests (macro shocks, unemployment spikes).
* Model governance: holdout sets, approval workflows, benchmark comparisons.

### Phase 8 — Productionization & Serving

* Expose scoring API (FastAPI) with versioning and model registry (MLflow).
* Feature-serving: feature store (Feast or custom) to ensure training/serving parity.
* Decisioning layer: business rules + score thresholds + manual review flags.
* Retraining pipelines: scheduled and event-driven retrain with drift detection.

### Phase 9 — Monitoring & Lifecycle Management

* Monitor model performance (AUC, KS, lift), calibration, PSI, latency, and business metrics.
* Automated alerts for drift or sudden metric shifts.
* Retrain, re-evaluate, and redeploy following governance.

# 4. Real Datasets & APIs

### Public / Benchmark Datasets

* **Lending Club Loan Data (Kaggle / public)** — historic consumer loan performance (originations + defaults).

*(These are for prototyping and benchmarking. Production models need your institution’s historic labeled loans.)*

# 8. Evaluation Metrics & Validation

### Modeling metrics

* ROC-AUC, PR-AUC (useful for imbalanced classes).
* KS-statistic (classic credit risk).
* Precision\@k, Recall\@k (top-k flagged defaults).
* Calibration (Brier score, reliability plots).
* Gini coefficient / Lift charts.

### Business & Portfolio metrics

* Expected Loss = PD × EAD × LGD (integrate with LGD & EAD models).
* Profit & loss by decision rule (approve/deny thresholds).
* False positive rate impact (lost originations), operational cost per manual review.

### Validation practices

* Temporal holdout (train on older cohorts, test on later cohorts).
* Backtesting on multiple economic cycles.
* PSI for feature and score stability.
* Stress tests and macro-scenario projections.

# 9. Risks, Pitfalls & Mitigations

* **Data leakage / lookahead bias**: enforce strict chronological splits; ensure training features don’t contain future info.
* **Class imbalance**: use stratified sampling, up/down-sampling, cost-sensitive learning, or proper evaluation metrics.
* **Label noise**: defaults can be mis-recorded; use label-cleaning heuristics and human review.
* **Regulatory/Privacy**: PII handling, explainability for adverse actions, compliant data retention.
* **Model degradation**: monitor PSI and performance drift; implement automatic retrain triggers.
* **Fairness & bias**: test for disparate impact and adjust via reweighting, constraints, or post-processing.
* **Operational latency**: ensure feature transforms are efficient for real-time scoring.
