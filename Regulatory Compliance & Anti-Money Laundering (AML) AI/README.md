## **1. Project Roadmap (Step-by-Step)**

### **Phase 1: Plan & Research**

* Understand AML laws in your region (FATF, KYC, OFAC sanctions list).
* Define what you want to detect:

  * Large unusual transfers
  * Frequent small suspicious transactions
  * Transactions linked to blacklisted accounts

---

### **Phase 2: Data Collection**

* Collect transactional data (amount, sender, receiver, time, location).
* Include:

  * Customer profile data (KYC)
  * Past suspicious activities (if available)
* APIs:

  * **OpenSanctions API** (sanctions & watchlists)
  * **FinCEN / FATF public reports**
  * **SWIFT payment dataset (for synthetic data)**

---

### **Phase 3: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

* Remove duplicates and errors.
* Standardize account IDs and currencies.
* Label known suspicious and normal transactions (for model training).

---

### **Phase 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Identify high-risk countries, accounts, and transaction patterns.
* Visualize frequency of suspicious activities.
* Correlate suspicious transactions with external watchlists.

---

### **Phase 5: AI Model Development**

**Models to use:**

* **Isolation Forest / Autoencoder (unsupervised)** – to detect anomalies.
* **Random Forest / XGBoost (supervised)** – if labeled data available.
* **Graph Neural Networks (advanced)** – for network-based laundering detection.

**Outputs:**

* Risk score for each transaction.
* Alert for suspicious activity.
* Reason for flagging (e.g., unusually high transfer, linked to risky account).

---

### **Phase 6: Compliance Rule Engine**

* Create a rule layer:

  * Transactions > \$10,000 flagged.
  * Multiple transfers within a short period flagged.
  * Accounts linked to sanction list blocked.

---

### **Phase 7: Reporting & Case Management**

* Generate automated reports (SAR – Suspicious Activity Report).
* Create cases for compliance teams to review.
* Integrate with email or dashboard notification.

---

### **Phase 8: Dashboard & User Interface**

* Risk dashboard:

  * Real-time transaction monitoring
  * Heatmaps of high-risk areas
  * Case management panel
* Tools: Streamlit / Dash / React.

---

### **Phase 9: Deployment & Continuous Learning**

* Deploy on secure cloud (AWS/GCP).
* Continuously retrain model as new suspicious patterns appear.

---
