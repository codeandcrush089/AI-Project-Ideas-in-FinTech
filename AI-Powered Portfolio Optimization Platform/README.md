# 1. Project goal 

Build a system that suggests how to split money across assets (stocks, bonds, ETFs, crypto) to reach a user’s goal (maximize returns, minimize risk, target return, or meet a goal date). Use AI to adapt allocations to changing markets.

---

# 2. Step-by-step roadmap (what to build, in order)

Phase 1 — Plan & requirements

* Decide asset classes (e.g., US stocks, ETFs, bonds, crypto).
* Decide user goals: max return for risk level, target return, conservation of capital, goal-date investing.
* Decide frequency: daily, weekly, monthly rebalancing.
* Define risk limits and compliance rules.

Phase 2 — Data collection & storage

* Gather historical price data, fundamentals, macro signals, factor data, and optionally sentiment/news.
* Store raw data in Parquet / CSV / time-series DB.

Phase 3 — Feature engineering & analytics

* Compute returns, volatilities, correlations, factor exposures, momentum, mean-reversion signals.
* Build a feature store so training and live use match.

Phase 4 — Model & optimization design

* Start with classic methods (mean-variance Markowitz, risk parity).
* Add ML: predict expected returns or factor returns (XGBoost / LightGBM / neural nets).
* Use AI-based optimizers: Reinforcement Learning (learn rebalancing policy), Bayesian optimization, or robust optimization to handle uncertainty.

Phase 5 — Backtesting & simulation

* Simulate strategies with transaction costs, slippage, and taxes.
* Use walk-forward validation and multiple market regimes.

Phase 6 — Portfolio engine & execution

* Build rebalancing engine with trade scheduling and order sizing.
* Connect to brokerage API for live / paper trading.

Phase 7 — UI & recommendations

* Build dashboard showing recommended allocation, expected return, risk, and backtest performance.
* Provide actionable items: “Rebalance now”, “Increase bond share to X%”, or “Auto-rebalance weekly”.

Phase 8 — Monitoring & retraining

* Monitor model performance, turnover, realized vs expected returns, and model drift.
* Retrain models on new data and tune optimization parameters.

Phase 9 — Deploy & iterate

* Deploy on cloud, add user accounts, permissions, and billing if needed.
* Collect user feedback and improve.

# 4. Real datasets & APIs (practical)

Public datasets for prototyping:

* **Yahoo Finance / yfinance** — free historical prices (easy prototyping).
* **Alpha Vantage** — free intraday/daily data (limited quotas).
* **Quandl (now Nasdaq Data Link)** — many economics/fundamental datasets.
* **Kaggle** — markets and factor datasets (momentum, value).
* **Fama-French datasets** — factor returns for factor models.

Paid / production-grade APIs:

* **Polygon.io** — intraday and tick-level (paid).
* **IEX Cloud** — market data and fundamentals.
* **Bloomberg / Refinitiv** — enterprise-grade (paid).
* **Alpaca / Interactive Brokers / Alpaca** — brokerage APIs for paper/live trading.
* **Sentiment APIs** (optional): Finnhub, NewsAPI, or social sentiment providers.

---

# 5. Ready-to-use advanced versions (production features)

* **Robust Optimization**: optimize for worst-case scenarios across a set of possible return/covariance models. This reduces sensitivity to estimation error.
* **Bayesian/Probabilistic Optimization**: build distribution over expected returns and pick allocations that maximize expected utility under uncertainty.
* **Model-Ensemble Forecasting**: combine multiple return predictors (ML + factor regressions) with model weights based on past performance.
* **Reinforcement Learning Rebalancer**: an RL agent learns when and how much to rebalance to maximize long-term reward (net returns after costs).
* **Transaction Cost Optimization / Smart Order Routing**: minimize market impact using slicing and execution strategies.
* **Personalization**: adapt allocations to user risk profile, liabilities, tax situation, and ESG preferences.
* **Scenario & Stress Testing**: instant stress test (rate shock, volatility spike) and show impact on portfolio.
* **Tax-aware Rebalancing**: minimize realized capital gains based on user tax brackets.
* **Explainable Recommendations**: show top drivers (e.g., “increase bonds due to rising volatility”) with simple language and charts.
* **Federated learning for advisor networks**: share learning across advisors without sharing raw user data.

---

# 6. Tech stack (simple list)

* **Languages**: Python (core), JavaScript/React (UI)
* **Data & ML**: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, xgboost/lightgbm, PyTorch/TensorFlow (if using RL)
* **Optimization libs**: cvxpy, scipy.optimize, PyPortfolioOpt (great for quick portfolio optimization)
* **Backtesting**: vectorized backtester, Backtrader (for order-level sim)
* **Serving**: FastAPI, Docker, Kubernetes (for scale)
* **DB / Storage**: PostgreSQL for metadata, Parquet/S3 for price data
* **Broker connect**: Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, or other broker APIs for execution
* **Dashboard**: Streamlit (quick) or React + D3/Plotly (production)
* **MLOps**: MLflow or DVC for model registry and experiments

# 8. Metrics to track (how you know it works)

Performance metrics:

* Cumulative return, annualized return, volatility, Sharpe ratio, Sortino ratio.
* Max drawdown, Calmar ratio.
* Turnover and transaction cost as % of returns.
* Hit-rate vs benchmark (e.g., outperformance over benchmark).
* Backtest robustness across different market regimes.

Operational metrics:

* Latency for generating recommendations.
* Rebalance frequency and number of trades.
* Model drift indicators (change in predictive errors).

User metrics:

* User acceptance rate of recommendations.
* Portfolio improvement vs user baseline (after fees & taxes).

---

# 9. Risks & simple mitigations

* **Estimation error** (bad expected returns) → use robust or shrinkage estimators; combine models; regularize.
* **Overfitting to historical data** → walk-forward validation; test across multiple regimes.
* **High turnover / costs** → include transaction costs in objective; penalize turnover.
* **Execution slippage** → simulate realistic slippage and have execution limits.
* **Regulatory / compliance** → keep audit logs and explainability for advisory recommendations.
* **User mismatch** (user risk appetite wrong) → include user questionnaire and safety caps.

* Compute returns, covariances, momentum, and volatility.

Week 2 — Build baseline optimizer

* Backtest monthly rebalancing over past 5–10 years with transaction costs and slippage.
* Produce performance charts vs benchmark.

Week 4 — Simple UI & API

* Build a small Streamlit or React UI that shows recommended weights, expected return, risk, and backtest results.

* Compare performance vs purely mean-variance.

Week 6 — Paper trading & monitoring

* Integrate with Alpaca paper trading for simulated live rebalancing.
* Add basic monitoring and logs.
