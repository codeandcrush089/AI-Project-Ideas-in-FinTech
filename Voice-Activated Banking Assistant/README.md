# 1. Project goal

Build a secure voice assistant that lets users do banking tasks by talking: check balance, transfer money, set bill reminders, get spending insights — all via voice on phone or smart speaker.

Key priorities: **security**, **accuracy**, **good user experience**, and **privacy**.

---

# 2. Step-by-step roadmap (what to build, in order)

**Phase 1 — Plan & rules**

* Decide supported tasks (balance, transfer, pay bill, recent transactions, budget tips).
* Define security rules (voice biometrics + PIN + 2FA).
* Check legal/compliance needs (PCI DSS for payments, GDPR for data).

**Phase 2 — Data & basic tech**

* Choose speech-to-text (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) engines.
* Choose NLP (intent detection + slot filling) or a conversational platform.
* Prepare sample dialogs (user asks, assistant replies).

**Phase 3 — Prototype**

* Make a simple flow for 3 core tasks (e.g., “Check balance”, “Send ₹500 to Ravi”, “Show recent transactions”).
* Hook ASR → NLP → Action → TTS.
* Use sandbox bank API or mock data.

**Phase 4 — Add security**

* Add voice authentication or PIN fallback.
* Add consent screens and logging (who did what and when).

**Phase 5 — Improve NLP & UX**

* Add dialog management (follow-ups, confirmations).
* Add error handling (“I didn’t get that — repeat?”).
* Add multilingual support if needed.

**Phase 6 — Integrate real banking APIs**

* Connect to real account data via Plaid / Yodlee (or bank’s API).
* Add payment execution via secure payment gateway.

**Phase 7 — Testing & compliance**

* Test for accuracy, latency, fraud cases.
* Complete privacy & security audits, penetration tests.

**Phase 8 — Deploy & monitor**

* Deploy backend services, monitor errors, voice recognition quality, suspicious activity.
* Collect user feedback and retrain models.

# 3. Core modules & features (what each part does)

### 1) Voice Input & ASR

* Converts user speech to text.
* Feature: noise robustness, short-turn & long-turn support.

### 2) Natural Language Understanding (NLU)

* Detects user intent (check\_balance, transfer, show\_transactions).
* Extracts entities/slots (amount, recipient, date).

### 3) Dialogue Manager

* Keeps context (e.g., follow-up “To whom?” after “Send money”).
* Manages confirmations, re-prompts, and error flows.

### 4) Business Logic / Banking Connector

* Validates intents, checks balance, creates transfers via banking API.
* Enforces rules: daily transfer limit, allowed recipients, fraud checks.

### 5) Voice Biometrics & Authentication

* Confirms user identity with voiceprint or voice + PIN.
* Fallback to OTP or 2FA if voice match is low.

### 6) Text-to-Speech (TTS)

* Replies to user in natural voice (short responses, confirmations).

### 7) Audit, Logging & Security

* Logs every action, request, response (immutable).
* Store minimum PII, encrypt data at rest & in transit.

### 8) Monitoring & Analytics

* Track ASR accuracy, latency, failed intents, suspicious patterns.

# 4. Real datasets & sample data (what to use to train / test)

### Speech / ASR datasets

* **LibriSpeech** — good for general English ASR prototyping.
* **Common Voice (Mozilla)** — multilingual open dataset (great for other languages).
* **VoxCeleb** — for speaker recognition / voice biometrics research.

### NLU / Intent datasets

* **ATIS** or **SNIPS** datasets — classic intent/slot examples (can adapt).
* **Create your own**: collect sample banking phrases (voice + text), annotate intents and slots. This is the most useful for banking.

### Banking / transaction test data

* Use **synthetic transaction logs** (fake accounts, fake payees, fake amounts).
* Or use sandbox test data from providers (Plaid/Yodlee sandbox or bank sandbox).

> Tip: for production you must collect real user voice samples with consent for voice biometrics and model tuning.

# 5. Useful APIs & services (plug-and-play)

### Speech & Conversation

* **Google Cloud Speech-to-Text** + **Text-to-Speech**
* **AWS Transcribe** + **Polly**
* **Azure Speech Services** (ASR, TTS, Speaker Recognition)
* **OpenAI / Whisper** (research / prototyping) — offline options available

### Conversational/NLU frameworks

* **Dialogflow (Google)** — easy and quick to build intents & slots.
* **Rasa** — open-source, good for on-prem and advanced flows.
* **Microsoft Bot Framework + LUIS** — strong enterprise support.

### Voice Biometrics / Speaker Recognition

* **Azure Speaker Recognition**
* **VoiceIt** (voice biometrics provider)
* **Custom models** built with VoxCeleb + PyTorch/TF if you need full control

### Banking / Financial connectors

* **Plaid** (account balance, transactions; sandbox for testing)
* **Yodlee / Salt Edge** — alternatives for account aggregation
* **Stripe / Razorpay** — for payments (if your flow needs to initiate payments)

### Notifications & 2FA

* **Twilio** — SMS/voice OTP, programmable voice calls.
* **Firebase** — push notifications + mobile integration.

# 6. Advanced / production-ready features (what a strong product has)

* **Strong voice authentication**: combine voice biometrics + behavioral signals + device fingerprint.
* **Multi-factor payment approval**: for big transfers require OTP or spoken PIN.
* **On-device ASR**: reduce latency & improve privacy (for mobile apps).
* **Multi-language & code-switching**: users can switch language mid-sentence.
* **Personalized voice & TTS**: friendly responses, short & concise confirmations.
* **Fraud prevention**: real-time anomaly detection (unusual amount, new payee, unusual location).
* **Explainability & audit**: logs and human-readable reasons for actions (needed for compliance).
* **Offline fallbacks**: if network fails, queue the action or read cached info.
* **Accessibility features**: larger font / transcript for hearing-impaired users.

---

# 7. Tech stack (simple list)

* **Language**: Python (backend), Node.js or React (frontend)
* **ASR/TTS**: Google / AWS / Azure or Whisper (prototype)
* **NLU/Dialog**: Dialogflow or Rasa
* **Auth & Biometrics**: Azure Speaker Recognition or VoiceIt
* **Banking APIs**: Plaid / Yodlee (sandbox → production)
* **Backend**: FastAPI / Flask (APIs), PostgreSQL (data), Redis (session/context)
* **Messaging**: Twilio (SMS/voice OTP), Firebase (push)
* **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes (k8s), or serverless (AWS Lambda)
* **Monitoring**: Prometheus + Grafana + ELK (logs)

# 9. Metrics to track (how to know it works)

**Accuracy & UX**

* ASR WER (Word Error Rate) — lower is better.
* NLU intent accuracy / slot F1 score.
* Task success rate (user finished task without help).
* End-to-end latency (voice→response) — keep low (<2s ideally for short tasks).

**Security & Business**

* False accept / false reject for voice biometrics.
* Fraud alerts triggered vs confirmed frauds (precision/recall).
* Number of failed transactions due to misrecognition (and recovery rate).

---

# 10. Risks & simple mitigations

* **Wrong transfers from misheard speech** → require explicit confirmation for money transfers (confirm amount & recipient verbally + PIN/OTP).
* **Voice spoofing attacks** → use anti-spoofing checks and require additional authentication for high-risk tasks.
* **Privacy concerns** → minimize stored audio, encrypt everything, use consent flow.
* **Regulatory issues** → follow PCI DSS for payments and local data protection laws (GDPR, etc.).
* **Poor ASR in noisy environment** → push “repeat” prompts, add noise-robust ASR or ask user to switch to app for confirmation.

---

# 11. Simple MVP plan (4–6 weeks)

Week 1 — **Prototype flow**

* Build ASR → NLU → simple action mapping for 3 tasks: check balance, list recent 5 transactions, transfer (mock).
* Use Google/Azure ASR and Dialogflow for intents.

Week 2 — **Add confirmations & TTS**

* Add spoken confirmations. Add simple text UI to show transcript + result.

Week 3 — **Add security**

* Add spoken PIN + OTP fallback for transfers. Log audit events.

Week 4 — **Connect sandbox bank**

* Integrate Plaid or bank sandbox for real balances/transactions.

Week 5 — **Testing & refine**

* Test with sample users, measure ASR errors, tune prompts, add re-prompt flows.

Week 6 — **Pilot**

* Run a small pilot with invited users; collect feedback, fix issues.
