# 1) Project Objective

Detect, prioritize, and explain potentially fraudulent insurance claims (auto, health, property, workers’ comp) using a mix of structured analytics, NLP on documents, computer vision on submitted images, graph analysis of actor networks, and real-time scoring so investigators can act quickly and accurately.

---

# 2) Step-by-Step Roadmap

### Phase 1 — Scope, Compliance & Requirements

* Choose line(s) of insurance (Auto, Health, Property, Workers’ Comp). Start with one (Auto or Property) for faster iteration.
* Define fraud types to detect: staged accidents, duplicate claims, inflated claims, provider collusion, identity theft.
* Compliance & privacy: HIPAA (health), GDPR/CCPA (personal data), local insurance regulations — include legal review and data retention policies.

### Phase 2 — Data Collection & Integration

* Internal systems: claims database, policy database, payment/settlement history, customer profiles, adjuster notes.
* External sources: police reports, repair shop invoices, vehicle registration, social media (public), telematics / IoT (if available).
* Documents & media: claim forms, invoices, images (damage photos), video, recorded calls.
* Integration connectors: SFTP/ETL to ingest batches, streaming connectors for near-real-time feeds.

### Phase 3 — Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

* Clean & standardize claims (dedupe, normalise vendor names, currency, units).
* Structured features: claimant history (prior claims), claim amount vs. expected, time-to-report, policy tenure, geography, provider frequency.
* Temporal features: claim rate per policy, rolling counts, seasonality.
* Text features: NLP embeddings for adjuster notes, claim descriptions, OCRed text from documents.
* Image features: damage localization, tampering detection, image metadata (EXIF), reverse-image checks.
* Graph features: build entity graph (claimants, providers, vehicles, addresses) and compute graph metrics (centrality, communities, repeated links).

### Phase 4 — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Visualize distributions: claim amounts, delays, counts per customer/provider.
* Compare known-fraud vs clean claims by key features.
* Network visualization to reveal clusters of suspicious providers or orchestrated rings.

### Phase 5 — Model Design & Development

* Multi-model architecture:

  * **Supervised models** (XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost) for classification (fraud/non-fraud) when labeled historic fraud exists.
  * **Unsupervised/anomaly detection** (Autoencoders, Isolation Forest, OneClass SVM) for novel fraud patterns.
  * **NLP models** (transformer embeddings or sentence2vec) to score suspicious language in descriptions/notes.
  * **Computer vision** (CNNs, pre-trained backbones + fine-tuning) to detect manipulated photos or mismatch between reported damage and images.
  * **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** / link-analysis to detect rings and suspicious provider networks.
  * **Ensemble/stacking** to combine signal sources into a final risk score.
* Explainability: SHAP or rule extraction for each flagged claim.

### Phase 6 — Scoring & Prioritization Engine

* Real-time/near-real-time scoring API that returns:

  * Fraud probability score, top contributing features, recommended priority level, suggested next action (investigate, require documents, deny hold), and explanation.
* Business rules layer for immediate decisions (e.g., hold payments > threshold until manual review).

### Phase 7 — Investigator Workspace & Dashboard

* Case queue prioritized by risk and expected recovery.
* Claim detail view: structured fields, timeline, documents, image viewer with overlayed CV results, graph links to related claims/providers, explainability panel (why flagged).
* Annotation & feedback system so investigators label outcomes (used for retraining).

### Phase 8 — Deployment, Monitoring & Model Lifecycle

* CI/CD for model updates, model registry, A/B or canary deployments to test new models on a fraction of traffic.
* Monitoring: model performance (precision/recall), drift detection, alerting for sudden spikes.
* Retraining pipelines with investigator-labeled outcomes and active learning loops.

# 4) Real Datasets & APIs (practical guidance)

> Note: realistic insurance fraud datasets are often proprietary or sensitive. For prototyping you can combine public datasets, synthetic data, and domain-specific Kaggle datasets; production requires partnerships or anonymized historic claims.

### Public / Research Datasets & Synthetic Sources

* **Kaggle**: look for auto-insurance or claim datasets (Allstate competition — claims severity; general claim datasets). Use these to prototype structured features and modeling approaches.
* **Open data sources** (public safety / police reports): to enrich auto accident claims with geolocation & incident validation.
* **Synthetic datasets**: generate labeled synthetic claims by simulating legitimate vs staged scenarios (useful for training computer vision and anomaly detectors).
* **Academic datasets**: published fraud detection datasets from research papers (search for insurance fraud datasets) — useful for method benchmarking.


### Useful APIs & Services

* **OCR & Document Understanding**: Google Cloud Vision OCR, AWS Textract, Azure Form Recognizer (extract fields from claim forms & invoices).
* **Identity / KYC**: Onfido, Jumio, or local KYC providers for identity verification.
* **Telematics / Vehicle Data**: If using auto telematics, providers like Verizon Connect or OEM telematics APIs.
* **Image Reverse Search / Metadata**: APIs to check if damage photos exist elsewhere (reverse image search via Bing Image Search API), EXIF metadata extraction.
* **Payment & Claims Systems Integration**: Guidewire, Duck Creek, or your insurer’s policy/claims system APIs (for enterprises).
* **Messaging / Alerts**: Twilio (SMS/voice), SendGrid (email) for notifying investigators or policyholders.
* **Graph / Network Databases**: Neo4j (graph queries), Amazon Neptune.
* **Geo / Address Validation**: Google Maps, HERE, or local address verification APIs.

# 5) Ready-to-Use Advanced Version — Production Features & Architecture

### Advanced Capabilities

* **Multi-modal fusion**: combine structured data + text + images + graph signals via a late-fusion ensemble to raise detection accuracy and reduce false positives.
* **GNN for ring detection**: train GNNs on entity graphs to predict suspicious clusters and provider collusion.
* **Forgery / Tamper detection**: CV models that detect image editing, inconsistent lighting/shadows, or reused imagery.
* **Speaker & call analytics**: speech-to-text + voice biometrics to detect suspicious call patterns or pressure tactics.
* **Federated learning**: collaborate across insurers to share model weights (not raw data) and improve detection on rare patterns while preserving privacy.
* **Active learning & human-in-the-loop**: prioritize ambiguous claims for human review and use their labels to iteratively improve models.
* **Explainable AI**: per-claim explanations and counterfactuals to comply with regulators and help investigators trust the model.
* **Risk scoring with expected recovery**: link predicted fraud to likely recovery amounts and ROI for investigation prioritization.
* **Automated evidence collection**: trigger requests for additional documents automatically based on detected gaps.

# 8) Evaluation Metrics & Validation

* **Classification metrics**: precision, recall, F1, ROC-AUC (BUT prioritize precision\@k and recall by priority tier — investigators care about too many false positives).
* **Business metrics**: true frauds detected, false positives (investigator hours wasted), average time to detection, expected recovery ROI, cost per detected fraud.
* **Operational metrics**: inference latency, queue lengths, model drift indicators.
* **Robustness tests**: adversarial examples for NLP/CV, scenario testing of new fraud types, stress tests for data volume spikes.

---

# 9) Practical Risks & Mitigations

* **Label quality**: historic labels may be noisy (some frauds undiscovered). Mitigate with human review loops and careful labeling policies.
* **Data privacy & legal**: health and personal data regulations require careful handling — anonymize and use purpose-limited systems.
* **False positives**: too many lead to lost customers and wasted investigator effort — tune for precision at top ranks, and provide clear explanations to speed manual review.
* **Adversarial adaptation**: fraudsters will adapt; use anomaly detection + active learning + quick retraining cycles.
* **Operational complexity**: multimodal systems are complex to maintain — start with structured+NLP baseline before adding CV and GNN.
